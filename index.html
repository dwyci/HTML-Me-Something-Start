            <h2>In 2007 I started mountain biking</h2>
            <li>When I first started mountain biking, it reminded me a lot of playing football</li>
               <li>It was a demanding sport that required a lot of conditioning and full body strength</li>
               <li>Also, there was some physical impact that reminded me of the colisions on the gridiron</li>
               <li>Numerous times I fell off my back and landed on some hard rock or rode straight into a tree</li>
               <li>Overtime, the sport has changed and so has my skills as a rider</li>
               <li>Bikes have bigger suspension and I am less likely to wreck</li>
               <li>But, it has opened the door to performing new acts like jumping a ramp or riding off a drop.</li>
               <li>And with new skills, you can travel to more remote places and create new experiences</li>

            <h2>In 2011 I started rock climbing</h2>
            <p>My wife and I joined a rock climbing gym.  Being in fitness my whole life, I was suprised how much different climbing is.  In climbing, it is better to use momentum and to change your body position to make it easier.  For contrast, in the weightroom, it's all about time under tension and keeping rigid form.  Eventually we graduated to climbing outside and learning new techniques that allow us to climb in unique places.</p>

            <h2>In 2022 I started running marathons.</h2>
            <p id="testp" class="funParagraph">When I was younger, I was always asked if I would run a marathon. I said, "When I am old, and when I am 40, then I will run them." Unfortunately, at the age of 40, I did not feel old. But, I kept my promise and I have now ran in three marathon races. Over the last few years, I learned to run slower when training and perform faster on race day. Previously, no matter what distance, I would run around a 10 minute mile. Now, I train slowly at a 12 minute pace. When I run a 5k, it is around 8 minute miles and a 10k is under 9.</p>
