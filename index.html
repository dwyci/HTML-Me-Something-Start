            <h2>In 2007 I started mountain biking</h2>
            <li>When I first started mountain biking, it reminded me a lot of playing football</li>
               <li>It was a demanding sport that required a lot of conditioning and full body strength</li>
               <li>Also, there was some physical impact that reminded me of the colisions on the gridiron</li>
               <li>Numerous times I fell off my back and landed on some hard rock or rode straight into a tree</li>
               <li>Overtime, the sport has changed and so has my skills as a rider</li>
               <li>Bikes have bigger suspension and I am less likely to wreck</li>
               <li>But, it has opened the door to performing new acts like jumping a ramp or riding off a drop.</li>
               <li>And with new skills, you can travel to more remote places and create new experiences</li>
